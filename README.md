Ranking items using a Bradley-Terry model.

Here is the model we're working with:
    P(X beats Y) = strength(x) / (strength(x) + strength(y))

where P(x beats y) is the probability that "x beats y"; x has a higer rank
than y does. You can write this as

    P(x > y) = etc.

I think it's pretty intuitive notation. I'll use it because it's less
keystrokes and I'm lazy.

Then:
    strength(x)
is a function that outputs a number*. This number is measuring whatever
quality you're ranking for the item x.

Intuitively, the higher the value of strength(x), the more of the quality
you're measuring x has. (The better it's rank, in theory.)

For example:
    Say I'm trying to rank my top 10 favorite baked sweets.
        Cake is #3
        Pie is #5
        (brownies are at least #2. #1 is corner-of-the-pan brownies)

        If strength values are a number between 1 and 10 (inclusive),
            strength(corner-brownies) = 10
            ...
            strength(cake) = 8
            ...
            strength(pie) = 6
            ... etc.

    Remember our model, P(x > y) = strength(x) / (strength(x) + strength(y))

    So, the probability that cake beats pie = about 0.57 **, whereas
    the probability that pie beats cake = only about 0.43.

    We conclude that higher ranked things will be expected to beat lower
    ranked things in a contest. Radical
    

* There are tricky properties this number needs to have which I can't say I
fully understand, but I think I've dealt with this appropriately in the code.

** That number is a total accident. Life is funny.

P.S.
In the code I throw around the word "game" a lot, I don't think I really
explain what I mean. A game is just a single round between two things
you're comparing.

Also, note that this model cannot handle ties. There is a way to do it but
I can't quite get my head around it. For now, the model essentially ignores
ties.
